> The UVP is hard to get right because you have to distill the essence of your product in a few words that can fit in the headline of your landing page. Additionally, your UVP also needs to be different and that difference needs to matter. First-time visitors spend 8 seconds on average on a landing page. Your UVP is their first interaction with your product - craft a good UVP and they might stay and view the rest of your site. Otherwise, theyâ€™ll simply leave.
