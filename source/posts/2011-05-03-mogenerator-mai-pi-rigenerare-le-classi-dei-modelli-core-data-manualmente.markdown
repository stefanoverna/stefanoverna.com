> `mogenerator` is a command-line tool that, given an `.xcdatamodel` file, will generate two classes per entity. The first class, `_MyEntity`, is intended solely for machine consumption and will be continuously overwritten to stay in sync with your data model. The second class, `MyEntity`, subclasses `_MyEntity`, won't ever be overwritten and is a great place to put your custom logic.

Dio, grazie.
