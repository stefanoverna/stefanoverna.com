Ne conoscevo solo 9. Notevole `tpp`, un precursore di [showoff](https://github.com/schacon/showoff):

> tpp stands for text presentation program and is an ncurses-based
presentation tool. The presentation can be written with your favorite
editor in a simple description format and then shown on any text
terminal that is supported by ncurses â€“ ranging from an old VT100 to the
Linux framebuffer to an xterm.
