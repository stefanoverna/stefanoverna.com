Presentazione di Mike Monteiro, Design Director di [Mule Design](www.muledesign.com), consigliata a chiunque sia alle prime armi col dover affrontare la sfida di gestire clienti, anche quando le cose non stanno andando come sperato (mi ricorda qualcuno). Spoiler: cercati un'avvocato.

> My advice to them is usually: you need to talk to a lawyer about this stuff. There are two things I hear the most: "Lawyers are too expensive. I can't afford them". The second: "Are we at that pointalready do you think?". You are at the point where you need a lawyer when you've decided stop being a design amateur and become a design professional. That's the time when you need a legal professional to look at those contracts.
