> Another important decision was to be totally ruthless and make real design decisions. All too often in the past I'd find myself falling for some piece of UI and nurture it at the expense of the surrounding elements. Or worse, I'd try to appease someone who was giving feedback or pushing for specific agendas versus trying to create the best UI. This time, however, I was careful to form as few emotional bonds as necessary and really work on rational arguments for everything I designed. By eliminating all but the most important pieces, those that remained always have some concrete purpose.
