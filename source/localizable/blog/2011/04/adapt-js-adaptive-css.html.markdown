Ennesima proposta per gestire CSS a piÃ¹ resoluzioni, suggerita dei creatori del grid system 960 e composta da un leggero script JS.

> Adapt.js is a lightweight (940 bytes minified) JavaScript file that determines which CSS file to load before the browser renders a page. It is worth noting this is a proposed, not prescribed, approach to a problem with multiple solutions. Other methods include: building a separate site for mobile, or using a media queries to adjust layouts dynamically, with a polyfill for older browser support. Also a factor is how to handle image resolutions.
