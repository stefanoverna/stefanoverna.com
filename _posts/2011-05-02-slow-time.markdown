> Communication doesn’t always have to be in real time. It can be in what we call "slow time". You can post something and three hours later someone can get back to you and then four hours later someone else can get back to you. And everything will work out just fine.
Slow time is "Maybe it takes two or three days to have this conversation. And we do it over periods of 15 minutes here, two minutes there, four minutes there." And that’s fine. It doesn’t need to happen all at once. Unless it’s really, incredibly, truly urgent. (Which most things aren’t. They’re made out to be that way, but they really aren’t that important.)
