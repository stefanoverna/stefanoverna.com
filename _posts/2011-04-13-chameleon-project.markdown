> If you're an iOS developer, you're already familiar with UIKit, the framework used to create apps for the iPhone, iPod and iPad. Chameleon is a drop in replacement for UIKit that runs on Mac OS X. In many cases, your iOS code doesn't need to change at all in order to run on a Mac.

Progetto sicuramente con del potenziale. [Twitterrific](http://twitterrific.com/) Ã¨ stato sviluppato su questo Framework.
